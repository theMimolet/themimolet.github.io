Hey everyone! 👋

BIG update this time !

Here's the plate of news you ordered, cooked medium rare, just for you !

## back to school

That's right, studies have started again and it's going to be interesting : the Linux distro i'm using (CachyOS) is making my life very easy (on Linux) and nothing (that I can't solve) gets in my way !

Moreover, I feel like I'm being more involved and I feel happy about all of it ! It's great !

## the website

I'm making a **HUGE** bet, and it's on the ability of Github action to deploy news from .md files!
If it's bugged, I guess you'll know soon enough, and I'll try to fix it ASAP.
And I've also improved lots of small parts of the website (like reorganising some parts, adding tab navigation between the different buttons, improving the links, etc...)

In the last post I told you I was going to learn NextJS, that was my plan indeed, but in the meantime it changed to Astro (another framework)

And what about now ? Well, I don't want to lose much time on the website and rather work on more interesting projects, so I'm not going to change, and build my own cozy environment instead, I don't need more 😄

## kindsun

I'm not going to lie or tease the project any longer, **it's dead** - it was fun thinking about, but realistically it didn't stick... RIP

## colourguess

I have actually changed my mind, the Godot version was on its way, but I believe it's better as a website
It might come back again as a part of this website, but I'll try to optimize it and make it better overall 👍

## the end

Aaaand that's it for now !

Stay tuned for more updates!

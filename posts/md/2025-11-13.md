Hi everyone !

It's been a while since I've last updated you, so here's what's been happening~

## the website.

I've improved the article generation since last month : **articles have now their own proper html pages** ! Yippie ! 

## distro of the week.

Ah yeah ! You caught me ! I changed distro **again** ! 

However this time is different, *CachyOS* was really nice, and I wouldn't have mind continuing using it (I was so close to reinstall with Hyprland !), but I was dying of curiosity with what the systems of *Universal Blue* had to offer !

*Universal Blue* are making immutable systems (*based on Fedora for now*) that offer automatic background system updates - so no need to care about them - and tools such as flatpak or homebrew to install apps and programs. I have to admit, it works really well ! They even maintain versions for developpers with QEMU/KVM and Visual Studio Code installed by default - **the dream** !

I'm currently using *Bluefin*, their system with an almost vanilla Gnome -  and it has dinosaurs as their mascotts !

But why did I try it in the first place ? Long story short, I have a dear friend that knows nothing about Linux, but want something to replace Windows that just works. So I've tried distros out until I found them and that's where it all began.  

You can check them out on their own website here :

## school.

We've just started so not much has happened yet... 

However there's a group that wants to make an "Undertale-like" game for this year, and I've joined them as one of the developpers ! I'm very excited to see where this will lead us and what we will achieve ! ^w^

## the end.

Aaaand that's it for now !

Stay tuned for more updates !

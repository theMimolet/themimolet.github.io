Hey everyone! 👋

If you read that message, then you must have found the RSS feed !

Awesome :3

Let's begin !

## the website

I removed the Colourguess Game from the site entirely - It had some quirks I hadn't noticed and I want to port the game on Godot

And I fixed a minor bug in the drop-down style.

## the projects

Well I can't promise anything right now - because I'm working on multiple projects and I have a tendency to procrastinate

What I can say is that if I keep the momentum with my projects, you might see something soon! (nbtr)

And you'll be the first to read it here ! 😉

## the end

That's it for now, I hope you enjoyed this little update!

Stay tuned for more updates!
